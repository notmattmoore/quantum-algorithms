## Software

[QuTiP](http://qutip.org) (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is open-source software designed for simulating "the dynamics of open quantum systems." So far, it has been useful for experimenting with the time-evolution of unitary operators and implementing algorithms. Software installation instructions can be found [here](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html) .

## Reference Texts
* [Classical and Quantum Computation][Kitaev Shen Vyalyi book]

  > An excellent resource for learning about quantum computation. Prior
  > experience with coordinate-free linear algebra is useful, but not required.

* [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information][Nielsen Chuang book]

  > This is a standard reference book that is highly regarded by many. It gives
  > more details than some other books, but sometimes details can be
  > distracting.

* [Linear Algebra for Quantum Computation](reference-texts/Portugal%20-%20Linear%20Algebra%20for%20Quantum%20Computation%20(Appendix).pdf)

  > This is an appendix from [Quantum Walks and Search Algorithms by Renato
  > Portugal][Portugal book]. It gives a concise but sufficient presentation of
  > the coordinate-free used in quantum computation.

* [Algebras, Lattices, Varieties Volume I][MMT ALV vol1]

  > A good introduction to universal algebra concepts, written in a very
  > approachable way. Chapters 1 and 2 cover much of the required background
  > material for the seminar. Note that this is the older 1987 edition. There is
  > a newer 2018 edition.

* [JB Nation's Notes on Lattice Theory](reference-texts/Nation%20-%20Notes%20on%20lattice%20theory.pdf)

  > Notes on order theory and lattice theory by a leader in the field.
