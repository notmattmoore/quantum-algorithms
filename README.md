## Software

[QuTiP](http://qutip.org) (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is open-source software designed for simulating "the dynamics of open quantum systems." So far, it has been useful for experimenting with the time-evolution of unitary operators and implementing algorithms. Software installation instructions can be found [here](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html) .

## Reference Texts
* [Classical and Quantum Computation][Kitaev Shen Vyalyi book]

  > An excellent resource for learning about quantum computation. Prior
  > experience with coordinate-free linear algebra is useful, but not required.

* [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information][Nielsen Chuang book]

  > This is a standard reference book that is highly regarded by many. It gives
  > more details than some other books, but sometimes details can be
  > distracting.
